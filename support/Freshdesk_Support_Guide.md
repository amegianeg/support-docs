## Six Phrases That Work for Excellent Customer Service

1. "I don't know, but I'll find out for you"
2. "I'd be frustrated too"
3. "I'd be happy to help you with this"
4. "I'll send you an update by [Day or Time]"
5. "I really appreciate you letting us know"
6. "Is there anything else I can help you with?"

## Feel, Felt, Found technique

This comes from the Apple customer service training manual.

**Feel:** Empathize with how the customer *feels* in that moment, and let them know that you understand.

**Felt:** Explain that you, too, once *felt* that way in the past.

**Found:** Tell the customer how you *found* that your concern was actually incorrect.

**Example:** "I can see why you'd feel that way. When I first started using it, I too felt that the app was a little complicated. But once I realized that I could just do **X**, I actually found it to be a lot simpler."

## Basics of Using Freshdesk

Head over to this URL and Login: [https://tutum.freshdesk.com/helpdesk](http://s.tutum.co.s3.amazonaws.com/support/images/Ticket_dashboard.png)

You will be at the Dashboard, which will look like this:

![FreshdeskDashboard](http://s.tutum.co.s3.amazonaws.com/support/images/Ticket_dashboard.png)

From the **Ticket summary**, you will want to click on **Open** tickets, or you can click on **Tickets** in the top menu.

## Tickets Dashboard

Here you'll find all of the tickets available. You can filter the tickets by using the left hand menu.

Clicking the top dropdown will also give you options for choosing common filters.

![TicketDashboardMenu](http://s.tutum.co.s3.amazonaws.com/support/images/ticket_menu_open.png)

On the right hand side, you will be able to see if the ticket is **New** or if it has already been responded to. You can also find the **Agent** assigned, **Status** and **Priority**.

## Answering Tickets

Once you've clicked on a ticket, you can now **Reply**.

On the right hand side, under **Ticket Properties** you can alter the **Priority**, **Status**, as well as assign another **Agent** and give it a **Tag**.

Depending on how you're able to resolve the ticket there will be a **Status** that you will need to set. 

**What are the different ticket statuses and what do they mean?**

**Open** - This is the default status of a ticket when it comes into your helpdesk. And, they are probably the ones that immediately need your support team's attention. Every time a customer replies to a ticket that has a different status, its always moves back to open so that you can take a look at it again and fix any issues, if necessary.  

**Pending** - A ticket can be moved into pending when you have replied to a ticket but haven't found the exact solution yet, and will respond later with the answer.

**Resolved** - When you are reasonably sure that you have provided the right solution to a customer, you can mark it as resolved. Once you do, the ticket can remain with the same status until the customer confirms that his issue has been fixed, upon which the ticket can be marked as closed. 

**Closed** - A ticket gets closed when a requester acknowledges that his issue has indeed been resolved by the customer. However, even if the ticket has been marked as closed, it will move back into open if the customer replies to it again. 

**Waiting on Customer** - Similar to **Pending**, but you will use this when you are waiting for information from our users.

**Waiting on Third Party** - You can set it to this status if there is a wait because of any third-party constraints that cannot be controlled by the support team (i.e. Azure OAuth, waiting on Microsoft).

## If You are Unable to Resolve a Ticket and Need Help

If there is any relevant information to help another agent click on **Add a Note** next to Reply/Forward. You can also notify another agent of your note at the top, with **Notify Agents:**

![AddANote](http://s.tutum.co.s3.amazonaws.com/support/images/Add_a_note.png)

Then under **Ticket Properties** change the **Status** to **Pending** and assign the relevant **Agent** with the dropdown menu. If the issue is a higher priority, you can also set the **Priority**.
