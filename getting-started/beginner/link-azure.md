## Overview 

You can link your Microsoft Azure account to your Tutum account to deploy **nodes** and **node clusters** using Tutum's Dashboard/API/CLI. Your Azure account is required in order to have Tutum interact with Azure on your behalf to create and manage your **nodes** (virtual machines).

navigate to **Account info \> Cloud Providers**. You'll see a list of all the providers you can link your Tutum account to. Go ahead and click on the **Link account**Â button for Microsoft Azure:
