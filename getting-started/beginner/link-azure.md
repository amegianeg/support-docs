## Overview 

You can link your Microsoft Azure account to your Tutum account to deploy **nodes** and **node clusters** using Tutum's Dashboard/API/CLI. Your Azure account is required in order to have Tutum interact with Azure on your behalf to create and manage your **nodes** (virtual machines).

## Link your Microsoft Azure account

Navigate to **Account info \> Cloud Providers**. You'll see a list of all the providers you can link your Tutum account to. Go ahead and click on the **Add credentials**Â button for Microsoft Azure:

Once uploaded, copy the **subscription ID** (which looks like `aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee`), enter it in Tutum's **Azure credentials** dialog, and click **Save credentials**.

You are now all set to start using Microsoft Azure as the infrastructure provider for Tutum. Click [here to learn how to deploy your first node](https://support.tutum.co/support/solutions/articles/5000523221).
